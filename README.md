<!--### Hi there
My name is Petal.Petalzu is a combination of my name and the abbreviation of the university I attended.  
I am a student majoring in data science and I will upload my Python project to GitHub to share with you.  
"Face the fear, create the future" is my motto.I hope it will help you.  

P.S.  
My avatar is set up by myself: a hard-working, gentle and lovely girl, petal. Like ACG, Toho project and Genshen impact.  
She can also play a little violin! That's amazing. OvO  

你好！ 这是写在注释中的话。 
我是Petal。Petalzu是我的名字和我就读的大学简称的拼接。  
我就读于数据科学专业。我会在学习python的过程中把项目和心得上传，希望对你有帮助。  
"Face the fear, create the future" 是我的座右铭，与诸君共勉。  
 
P.S.  
我的头像是自设：学习勤奋，温柔可爱的女孩Petal。喜欢ACG, TOHO project和原神。  
她还会一点小提琴！真是令人惊讶呢。OvO
